        <p className="text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-400 ">
          The concept for our logo is derived from the shape of human hands, the shape they make when held with the palms facing each other. Usually, when we hold an object in our palms, it is something we care about, something valuable to us. Like when a blow of air attempts to put off a candle that gives us light, we protect it with our palms. When a tiny bird falls from its nest, we hold it up and protect it in our palms. When a sculptor sculpts a masterpiece, he shapes it using his fingers and palms. Hence, our logo depicts the amount of care and emotion we put into each and every creation. Moreover, it is a symbol that inspires us on a daily basis to be caring towards our clients and protect their interests by providing an uncompromising level of service and superior products.
